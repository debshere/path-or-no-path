# path-or-no-path
Given multiple nodes that create connected and (or) or disconnected graphs, this project uses the DFS algorithm to check whether or not path exists between any two given nodes
(say u and v)

Input Format: An undirected graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges. The next line contains two vertices 𝑢
and 𝑣 of the graph.

Output Format: Output 1 if there is a path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 and 0 otherwise.
